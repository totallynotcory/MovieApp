#Movie App
Project built for the Udacity Android Nanodegree

##Description:
In the second project for the Udacity Android Nanodegree, students are asked to create an App to discorver new movies.  Through two classes, the students are brought from the very basics of App creation to expand on the intricacies of many essential parts of Android development.  This App makes use of several libraries, a movie database API, follows material design conventions, has portrait and landscape as well as table and phone designs, and includes many more fundamentals of Android App creation.

##Getting Started

"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
